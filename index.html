              <p>I am proactive and conscientious in my studies and work, able to complete tasks according to established plans. I possess good interpersonal skills and team organization abilities, capable of organizing teams and dividing work effectively. I have a solid foundation in programming and good coding practices, and can choose appropriate tools to complete tasks according to given requirements. I am also willing to contribute and share my professional knowledge, having participated in a series of programming tutoring activities for freshmen and children. Previously, I organized a team to participate in the National College Student Mathematical Contest in Modeling, responsible for team organization and programming, and led the team to win the national first prize. As a sophomore, I am aware of my knowledge and experience shortcomings and will continue to improve myself in future studies and life.</p>
